## About Permanent Junk

> This addon does one, and only one thing: mark items as junk, **permanently**.

I found it quite annoying once I sold items as junk marked, these items when re-acquired being unmarked as junk.

There are a lot of addons that already do that, but they add a lot of additional features. The automation they provide is amazing, but I consider these breaking my gameplay immersion.

 
- [Remember Junk](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info470-RememberJunk.html) This is the closest fitting my needs. However it adds add features through commands such as clearing/list junked items.
- [Zolan's Junk Handler](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info285-ZolansJunkHandler.html)
- [Deconstruction Junk Marker](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1388-DeconstructionJunkMarker.html)
- [Dustman](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info97-Dustman.html)
- [JunkBuster](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info266-JunkBuster.html)
